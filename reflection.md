For my Session 12 final project, I developed a Full-Stack Study Planner designed to help students manage their academic workload for the year 2026. The application was built using a Python backend with the Flask framework, while the frontend was constructed using HTML5 and CSS3. Data persistence was managed through a data.json file, which allowed the application to store, retrieve, and update tasks without needing a complex SQL database.
The core functionality of the app follows the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) model. Users can create new tasks via a dedicated "Add Task" page, view their list on a clean dashboard, edit existing tasks to update deadlines or priorities, and delete tasks they no longer need. I also implemented a "Check" feature that allows users to toggle the completion status of a task, which visually updates the interface to show progress. I chose a green and yellow color palette to give the app a "fresh and energetic" feel, perfect for a productivity tool.
Part 2: The Learning and Technical Challenges
The biggest learning curve in Phase 2 was understanding how the backend communicates with the frontend. Specifically, I had to learn how to use POST requests to send data from an HTML form into a Python dictionary, and then save that dictionary into a JSON file. Early in the process, I struggled with "KeyErrors" because my HTML input names didn't match my Python keys. Solving this taught me the importance of data consistency in full-stack development.
Another challenge was the Edit functionality. Unlike adding a task, editing requires the app to find a specific task by its unique ID, load its current data into a form, and then overwrite only that specific entry. This required a deeper understanding of Python logic and Flask routing. I also spent significant time mastering the HTML5 Date Input. I wanted a professional-looking calendar for the year 2026, and I had to ensure the date format saved to the JSON file was easy to read and sort.
Part 3: Growth and AI Collaboration
Reflecting on my progress since Session 7, my growth has been substantial. Six weeks ago, I could only build static websites that didn't "do" anything. Now, I am capable of building dynamic applications that handle user data. I now understand that the "brain" of the website lives in the server (app.py), while the "face" lives in the templates.
I used AI throughout this phase as a collaborative coding partner. Whenever I encountered a syntax error or my server wouldn't start, I used AI to help debug my code. It was especially helpful in writing the CSS for the "Priority" badges and the "High/Medium/Low" logic. AI didn't just give me code; it helped me understand why certain functions weren't working, which made me a more confident programmer. I learned how to "clean" my code to make it more professional and easier to present to the class.
Part 4: Future Goals
If I had more time, I would like to implement a "Sort" feature that automatically puts "High Priority" tasks at the top of the list. I would also like to add user accounts so that different students could have their own private planners. Looking ahead to Phase 3, I am excited to learn more about Databases and JavaScript. I want my next project to have "Live Updates" where the page doesn't have to refresh to show a new task. This project has given me the foundation I need to pursue more complex software engineering goals.
